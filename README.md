DKENV
-----
dkenv is a tool that downloads Docker versions for you, keeps track of your versions, and lets you switch between docker versions on the fly. You can also specify the apiversion on the command line and dkenv will select the correct docker version.

Designed to bypass the dreaded:

    2014/08/26 14:21:03 Error response from daemon: client and server don't have same version (client : 1.13, server: 1.12)


Use:

    dkenv --version version

    dkenv --apiVersion apiVersion

    dkenv --list

Version example: "1.6.0"

API Version example: "1.18"

dkenv stores the docker files in ~/.dkenv and creates a symlink in /usr/local/bin

Pull requests should:

 * Clearly state their intent in the title
